In recent years, the rapid expansion of social media platforms and online communities has not only facilitated greater connectivity and communication but has also revealed a darker side: hate speech and online harassment.<br>

In this project, we explored the challenge of detecting hate speech using machine learning, NLP techniques, and LLMs for sentiment analysis. Our focus was on comparing a **Keras** neural network model to two advanced Large Language Models (LLMs): **Mistral-7b** and **Llama-2-7b**. The objective was to classify text as offensive or non-offensive (a binary classification task), leveraging three distinct datasets.

#### **Keras NN vs. Mistral-7b vs. Llama-2-7b**
Our approach involved training a Keras neural network on the **entire dataset**, which comprised 140,218 rows of text collected from various sources, including Wikipedia forums. However, **the LLMs were fine-tuned using only 0.08% of the training data**, utilizing LoRa (Low-Rank Adaptation), a technique for optimizing model performance. Additionally, we explored the performance of the LLMs with prompt engineering.<br><br>
The results offer insights into hate speech detection. Through our exploration, we gained a deeper understanding of the challenges, strengths, and limitations of each model or approach for this specific task. We invite you to join us on this journey!
